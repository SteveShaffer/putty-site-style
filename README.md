PuTTY Site Style
================

CSS for the [PuTTY site](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) to
make it a little more stylish

## Disclaimer

I don't own, maintain, distribute, or really have anything to do with PuTTY.
This is purely a css layer for someone else's webpage.

## Why?

Because it's awesome old-school raw HTML, but some modern responsive stylings
never hurt no one.

...and because I wanted a css-only facelift challenge. :-)
